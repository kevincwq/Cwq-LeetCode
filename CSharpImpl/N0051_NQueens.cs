    /// The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
    /// [<https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/8-queens.png>]
    /// Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
    /// Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.
    /// Example 1:
    /// Input: 4
    /// Output: [ 
    ///             [".Q..", "...Q", "Q...", "..Q."], // Solution 1
    ///             ["..Q.", "Q...", "...Q", ".Q.."]  // Solution 2 
    ///         ]
    /// Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above.
    /// 
    /// Example 2:
    /// Input: n = 1
    /// Output: [["Q"]]
    /// 
    /// Constraints:
    /// 1 <= n <= 9
