    /// 
    /// Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.
    /// For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.
    /// Example:
    /// Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9], One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST: 0 / \ -3 9 / / -10 5
