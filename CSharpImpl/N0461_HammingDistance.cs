    /// The Hamming distance<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance> between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
    /// Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.
    /// Note:
    /// 0 ≤ x, y < 2^31.
    /// 
    /// Example:
    /// 
    /// Input: x = 1, y = 4
    /// Output: 2
    /// Explanation: 1 (0 0 0 1) 4 (0 1 0 0) ↑ ↑ The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
