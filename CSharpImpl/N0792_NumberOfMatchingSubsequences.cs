    /// Given string S and a dictionary of words words, find the number of words[i] that is a subsequence of S.
    /// Example :
    /// Input: S = "abcde" words = ["a", "bb", "acd", "ace"]
    /// Output: 3
    /// Explanation: There are three words in words that are a subsequence of S: "a", "acd", "ace".
    /// 
    /// Note:
    /// * All words in words and S will only consists of lowercase letters.
    /// * The length of S will be in the range of [1, 50000].
    /// * The length of words will be in the range of [1, 5000].
    /// * The length of words[i] will be in the range of [1, 50].
