    /// 
    /// Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum absolute difference<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_difference> between values of any two nodes.
    /// Example:
    /// Input: 1 \ 3 / 2
    /// Output:
    /// 1
    /// Explanation:
    /// The minimum absolute difference is 1, which is the difference between 2 and 1 (or between 2 and 3).
    /// 
    /// 
    /// Note:
    /// * There are at least two nodes in this BST.
