    /// Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.
    /// The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.
    /// Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
    /// Example:
    /// Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
    /// 3 / \ 9 20 / \ 15 7
    /// 
    /// return its minimum depth = 2.
