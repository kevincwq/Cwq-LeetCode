    /// Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
    /// Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
    /// Example:
    /// Input:Â [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
    /// Output: 4
    /// Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
