    /// There is a group of G members, and a list of various crimes they could commit.
    /// The i^th crime generates a profit[i] and requires group[i] members to participate in it.
    /// If a member participates in one crime, that member can't participate in another crime.
    /// Let's call a profitable scheme any subset of these crimes that generates at least P profit, and the total number of members participating in that subset of crimes is at most G.
    /// How many schemes can be chosen?  Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
    /// 
    /// Example 1:
    /// Input: G = 5, P = 3, group = [2,2], profit = [2,3]
    /// Output: 2
    /// Explanation: To make a profit of at least 3, the group could either commit crimes 0 and 1, or just crime 1.
    /// In total, there are 2 schemes.
    /// 
    /// Example 2:
    /// Input: G = 10, P = 5, group = [2,3,5], profit = [6,7,8]
    /// Output: 7
    /// Explanation: To make a profit of at least 5, the group could commit any crimes, as long as they commit one.
    /// There are 7 possible schemes: (0), (1), (2), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), and (0,1,2).
    /// 
    /// 
    /// 
    /// Note:
    /// 1. 1 <= G <= 100
    /// 2. 0 <= P <= 100
    /// 3. 1 <= group[i] <= 100
    /// 4. 0 <= profit[i] <= 100
    /// 5. 1 <= group.length = profit.length <= 100
