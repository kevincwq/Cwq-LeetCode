    /// Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
    /// 
    /// Example:
    /// Given a binary tree
    /// 1 / \ 2 3 / \ 4 5
    /// 
    /// Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
    /// 
    /// Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
