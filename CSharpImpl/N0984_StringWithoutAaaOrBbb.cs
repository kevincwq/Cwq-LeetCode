    /// Given two integers A and B, return any string S such that:
    /// * S has length A + B and contains exactly A 'a' letters, and exactly B 'b' letters;
    /// * The substring 'aaa' does not occur in S;
    /// * The substring 'bbb' does not occur in S.
    /// 
    /// Example 1:
    /// Input: A = 1, B = 2
    /// Output: "abb"
    /// Explanation: "abb", "bab" and "bba" are all correct answers.
    /// 
    /// Example 2:
    /// Input: A = 4, B = 1
    /// Output: "aabaa"
    /// 
    /// 
    /// 
    /// Note:
    /// 1. 0 <= A <= 100
    /// 2. 0 <= B <= 100
    /// 3. It is guaranteed such an S exists for the given A and B.
