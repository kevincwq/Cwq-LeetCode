    /// 
    /// Given n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n_ , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, a_i). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, a_i) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
    /// Notice that you may not slant the container.
    /// 
    /// Example 1:
    /// [<https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg>]Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
    /// Output: 49
    /// Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
    /// 
    /// Example 2:
    /// Input: height = [1,1]
    /// Output: 1
    /// 
    /// Example 3:
    /// Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
    /// Output: 16
    /// 
    /// Example 4:
    /// Input: height = [1,2,1]
    /// Output: 2
    /// 
    /// 
    /// Constraints:
    /// * 2 <= height.length <= 3 * 10^4
    /// * 0 <= height[i] <= 3 * 10^4
