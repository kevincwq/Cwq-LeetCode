    /// You are given an integer array nums and you have to return a new counts array. The counts array has the property where counts[i] is the number of smaller elements to the right of nums[i].
    /// 
    /// Example 1:
    /// Input: nums = [5,2,6,1]
    /// Output: [2,1,1,0]
    /// Explanation:
    /// To the right of 5 there are 2 smaller elements (2 and 1).
    /// To the right of 2 there is only 1 smaller element (1).
    /// To the right of 6 there is 1 smaller element (1).
    /// To the right of 1 there is 0 smaller element.
    /// 
    /// 
    /// Constraints:
    /// * 0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
    /// * -10^4Â <= nums[i] <= 10^4
