    /// Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n pairs of integer, say (a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), ..., (a_n, b_n) which makes sum of min(a_i, b_i) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.
    /// 
    /// Example 1:
    /// Input: [1,4,3,2]
    /// Output: 4
    /// Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3, 4).
    /// 
    /// Note:
    /// 
    /// 1. n is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
    /// 2. All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].
