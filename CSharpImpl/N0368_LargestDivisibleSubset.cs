    /// 
    /// Given a set of distinct positive integers, find the largest subset such that every pair (S_i, S_j) of elements in this subset satisfies:
    /// S_i % S_j = 0 or S_j % S_i = 0.
    /// If there are multiple solutions, return any subset is fine.
    /// Example 1:
    /// Input: [1,2,3]
    /// Output: [1,2] (of course, [1,3] will also be ok)
    /// 
    /// Example 2:
    /// Input: [1,2,4,8]
    /// Output: [1,2,4,8]
