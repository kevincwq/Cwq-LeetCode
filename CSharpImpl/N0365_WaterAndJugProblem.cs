    /// 
    /// You are given two jugs with capacities x and y litres. There is an infinite amount of water supply available. You need to determine whether it is possible to measure exactly z litres using these two jugs.
    /// If z liters of water is measurable, you must have z liters of water contained within one or both buckets by the end.
    /// Operations allowed:
    /// * Fill any of the jugs completely with water.
    /// * Empty any of the jugs.
    /// * Pour water from one jug into another till the other jug is completely full or the first jug itself is empty.
    /// Example 1: (From the famous "Die Hard" example<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVtQNK_ZUJg>)
    /// Input: x = 3, y = 5, z = 4 Output: True
    /// 
    /// Example 2:
    /// Input: x = 2, y = 6, z = 5 Output: False
    /// 
    /// 
    /// Constraints:
    /// * 0 <= x <= 10^6
    /// * 0 <= y <= 10^6
    /// * 0 <= z <= 10^6
